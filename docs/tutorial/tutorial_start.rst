Tutorial: Understanding the structure of TorchPhysics
=====================================================
In this tutorial, you will learn how the different components of TorchPhysics
work and at end will be able to transform a simple differential equation into the
corresponding problem in TorchPhysics.

We start by explaining the basic structure of this library. Then we will go over each 
important part in their own little example and in the end bring everything together to
solve a PDE.

The structure is best illustrated by the following graph:
